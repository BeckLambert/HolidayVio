# HolidayVio

This is the holiday planning app for the procrastinators of the world!

HolidayVio has a calendar with event's going on in your area, a list of shops relevant to the holiday and a fun quotes section for each holiday. 

Since this is a procrastinators app each holiday page will only be unlocked a week prior to the holiday. You can sign up to get an email notification telling you when the page is unlocked and in the mean time enjoy a fun countdown. Each page has it's own themed countdown.
